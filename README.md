# Makves-test
React + recharts library.
The test is to mark vith red areas on Chart that goes out from  area: average +/- standart deviation.
All problem was in changing data (could be not only plus, but minus). 
In this case the Rechart lib has some difficulties with plot boundaries in YAxis, that can be overcome.
